# Lab 2: Importing assets and creating models

> Although this lab is **not** graded, I encourage you to showcase your final work to me during the lab and I'll provide you with some feedback.

## Prerequisites
* Unity is installed and set up.

# Task 1
1. Create a new empty 3D project from Unity Hub
1. Download and extract the following .zip files which contain your assets:
    - [assets](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AvNVN__FAFfygddukV-IQ-QK_R7cGw)
1. After extraction is complete, import all your assets into your Unity Project.
    - ![image](https://docs.unity3d.com/2017.2/Documentation/uploads/Main/sketchup1.png)
    - Select the model file `.fbx`, `.dae` or `.obj`
    - Re-import and select all the textures images
- ALternatively, you could copy the extracted folders to the project location under the `Assets/` folder and then Re-import all assets.  
> Textures are not attached to the models as materials by default when you import external assets. You need to drag and drop the `.jpg` or `.png` image from your project view in the lower pane to the corresponding model in the hierarchy pane.
4. Now you should have the building blocks to start the task.
5. Create a mini bowling game with these sepcifications:
    - Pins should rest at the end of a bowling alley
    - Ability to throw the ball on the bowling alley towards the pins
    - Try out different movement strategies for moving the ball:
        - Simple input mapping (check example below)
        - Translate
        - Force
> For inputs to control the ball or if you want to map a button to trigger the throw, you may consult the following example: [unity spacebar input example](https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/csharp/unity+spacebar+input)
