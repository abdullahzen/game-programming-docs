# Submission Guide

> Make sure the `.gitignore` file is located in the root of the Unity project. (Same parent folder that contains the `Assets` folder)

1. Create a single Github Repo for all future labs. (**Please make sure the repository is private**)
1. Perform the following steps to create a folder for the lab and set up the `.gitignore`:
```bash
git clone your_repo_url
cd your_repo_name
mkdir graded_lab_x
cd graded_lab_x
touch .gitignore
```
3. Copy the content of [this file](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Unity.gitignore) to the `.gitignore` file you just created in the previous step.
1. Copy all your project files (source code) to your Github repo under the corresponding lab folder e.g. `graded_lab_x`
1. If you get errors about large file sizes, it means the `.gitignore` file was not added properly so please repeat the steps to add it properly.
1. Add my username `abdullahzen` as a collaborator, so I can have access and provide feedback.
