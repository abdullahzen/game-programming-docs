## Prerequisites

* Extract and copy the folder `GradedLab4`
* Rename the project to `GradedLab4_firstname`
* Load the project in unity

# Task 1
* Create a particle system to create the following:
    * Fire: it should decrease the player's health whenever the player is inside it. Also, It should play a burning sound as long as the player is inside it.
    * Plus signs on a healing circle (plus signs image included): It should play a healing sound and re-fill the player's health. (healing effect)

# Task 2
* Implement a health bar reflective of the player's health on the Hero prefab (player). 
> Hint: to modify a prefab, click on the Hero in the project view at the bottom and then `Open Prefab` from the right hand window, and then modifying that object will modify the prefab itself.
> Another hint: be inspired by the existing but inactive health bar on the Decoys prefab
